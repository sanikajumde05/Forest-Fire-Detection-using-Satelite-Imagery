# Forest-Fire-Detection-using-Satelite-Imagery
Project Overview
This project utilizes deep learning techniques to detect forest fires from satellite images. Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the model classifies images to identify fire-affected regions, aiding in early detection and prevention of wildfires.

🚀 Features
* Preprocessing and augmentation of satellite imagery
* CNN-based image classification for fire detection
* Model training, validation, and testing
* Implementation using TensorFlow and Keras

🛠️ Technologies Used
* Python
* TensorFlow & Keras
* OpenCV & PIL for image processing
* Jupyter Notebook

📊 Dataset
The project uses satellite images of forests, categorized into fire and non-fire images for model training and evaluation.

🔥 How to Use
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies
3. Load and preprocess image data
4. Train the CNN model
5. Test with new images
